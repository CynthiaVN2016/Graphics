```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Click on test.html. To draw the image, upload a json file first (for example, the input.json) file. Once that has been uploaded, draw the scene by pushing the button. An image similar to the one below will appear. Pressing the play button will make the sphere move in a circular path.
